    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Cauliflower</li>
        <li>Chickpeas</li>
        <li>Seasonings</li>
        <li>Greens</li>
        <li>Avocado</li>
        <li>Red Onion</li>
        <li>Pine nuts</li>
        <li>Tahini dressings</li>
        <li>Extra lemon wedges</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
          <li>Prep the oven and baking sheet. Heat oven to 425Â°F. Mist a large baking sheet with cooking spray.</li>
         <li>Prep the cauliflower and chickpeas. In a large bowl, add the cauliflower florets, chickpeas, oil, sea salt,
            cumin, garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika and black pepper. Toss gently until combined, then pour the
            mixture out onto the baking sheet and spread out in an even layer. </li>
         <li>Bake. Bake for 25-30 minutes, stirring once halfway through, until the cauliflower is tender and slightly
            charred around the edges. Transfer the pan to a wire cooling rack. </li>
         <li>Make the dressing. Meanwhile, in a small bowl or mason jar, whisk together tahini, lemon juice, cumin, garlic,
            and 2 tablespoons warm water until smooth. Add extra warm water as needed, until the dressing reaches your
            desired consistency, then season with salt and pepper to taste. </li>
         <li>Finish the salad. In a large bowl or serving plate, combine the arugula, avocado, red onion, pine nuts, roasted
            cauliflower and chickpeas. Drizzle evenly with the tahini dressing, serve with extra lemon wedges for squeezing,
            and enjoy! </li>
    </ol>
