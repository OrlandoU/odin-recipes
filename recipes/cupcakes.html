        <li>1 cup granulated sugar </li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking so</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon s</li>
        <li>1/4 cup salted butter, room temperature</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, room temperature</li>
        <li>1/3 cup full-fat sour cream</li>
        <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil (or canola o</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extra</li>
        <li>2/3 cup whole milk, room temperature</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <h4>To make the cupcake:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Prep the oven and cupcake liners. Heat oven to 350°F (180°C). Line two cupcake pans with about 16 liners
            total
            (or you can bake multiple batches with one pan). </li>
        <li>Mix together the dry ingredients. In a large mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer, whisk together cake
            flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt until combined. </li>
        <li>Add the butter. Add the butter (be sure that it is room temperature) and mix on medium-low speed for 3
            minutes,
            scraping down the sides as needed. The batter should have a fine crumb texture.</li>
        <li>Whisk together the wet ingredients. In a separate small bowl, whisk together the eggs, sour cream, oil and
            vanilla extract until smooth.</li>
        <li> Add the wet ingredients. Add the egg mixture to the flour mixture and beat on medium-speed for 30 seconds,
            or
            until just combined. Reduce speed to low and gradually add the milk until it is just combined. The batter
            will
            be liquid.</li>
        <li>Bake. Fill the cupcake liners so that they are just over halfway full. Bake for 14 to 16 minutes, or until a
            toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean. Transfer the pan to a wire rack and let the cupcakes cool
            completely to room temperature.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>To make the buttercream:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Beat the butter. Add the butter to a large mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer and beat on medium speed
            for
            2 to 3 minutes until it is light and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Add the remaining ingredients. Add the powdered sugar, heavy cream and vanilla extract and beat on low speed
            for
            1 minute until combined. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, then beat on medium speed for 2 more minutes
            until
            completely smooth.</li>
        <li>Adjust consistency if needed. If the buttercream seems too thin, add in 1 to 2 cups of additional powdered
            sugar
            and beat until smooth. If the buttercream seems too thick, add in 1 tablespoon of heavy cream (or more, if
            needed) and beat until smooth. See notes below for storage directions.</li>
